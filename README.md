# Current feasibility-tested hack question set

### TEXT ANALYSIS - (Correlation between GPG data and another source of text data at company level):
* Recruitment bias in senior roles (data source: Reed)
* Company ‘self’ description (data source: Reed)
* Action plans as described in Company GPG reports (source links in the GPG company page)
* Twitter #PayGap (company Level?)

### THE CEO QUESTION:
* Composition of the board (sources: Company House or company’s website)
* Gender of the CEO (sources: Company House or company’s website)

### CUSTOMER SERVICE:
* Correlation between GPG and Customer Service Rating as available in TrustPilot

### DEEP DIVES:
* What can we learn from the 11% of companies with a >0 pay gap?
* Are the patterns different for Charitable organisations?
* What can we learn from the companies with <250 employees which have voluntarily filed their data?
* Correlation with the existence of a flexible work policy
* Correlation with the existence of a diversity policy
* Correlation with any feedback available on the company culture

### MEDIA REVIEW:
* Critical review the analytical methods used to draw conclusions about GPG in mainstream media + suggest more analysis

#### April 2016 #Hackthepaygap initiative where team of Presidential Innovation Fellows, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House Council on Women and Girls launched a challenge culminating in a White House 'Demo Day', asking developers, designers, and data scientists across the US: can you use your skills to help get women paid what they deserve?

#### The gender pay gap in the NHS 
* https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k1541
* `With over 1.6 million staff, the NHS is the largest single employer in the UK, three times the size of the largest private sector employer, Tesco...The new requirement for large employers to publish basic data shows the scale of the discrepancy in the NHS...`

#### Recruitment Bias > Accessibility / Awareness / Perfect Information
* WHERE are jobs, particularly the higher paid ones, advertised? ARE they even fully advertised? i.e. biased reach, closed networks

#### A pseudo-Bechdel Test for detecting/identifying organisational gender bias
